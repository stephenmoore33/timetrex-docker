this Agreement. "Initial Licensed User" means a Company employee authorized
to use the Software upon Company's payment of the License Fee. "Additional
Licensed Users" means a Company employee authorized to use the Software after

of this Agreement. Collectively, all of the "Initial Licensed Users" and
"Additional Licensed Users" comprise, and shall be referred to, as the
"Licensed Users". "Third-Party Software" means certain software TimeTrex
licenses from third parties and provides to you with or within the Software.
Certain Third-Party Software provided with the Software is subject to various
other terms and conditions imposed by the licensors of such Third-Party
Software. As applicable, the terms of your use of the Third-Party Software is
subject to and governed by their respective licenses except that Section 4.2
("As is/Disclaimer of Warranty") and Section 5 ("Limitation of Liability") of
this Agreement also govern your use of the Third-Party Software. You may view

licenses. You are hereby notified that certain persons and entities who have
licensed Third-Party Software to TimeTrex for inclusion in the Software are
third party beneficiaries to this Agreement as it applies to their respective
software product(s) included in the Software. The Software will be deemed
accepted by Company on the date Company checks the "I ACCEPT" box.

1.2 Restrictions. Company shall not, directly or indirectly: (i) sublicense,
resell, rent, lease, distribute, market, commercialize or otherwise transfer
rights or usage to: (a) the Software, (b) any modified version or derivative
work of the Software created by the Company or for the Company, or (c) any
software, either modified or not, licensed under a TimeTrex Public License, for
any purpose including timesharing or service bureau purposes; (ii) remove or
alter any copyright, trademark or proprietary notice in the Software; (iii)

any TimeTrex open source licensed products into a separately maintained source
code repository so that development done on the original code requires manual
work to be transferred to the forked software or so that the forked software
starts to have features not present in the original software. The Software
includes modules that reports the number of authorized Licensed Users and
permits TimeTrex the ability to monitor certain usage of the Software
("Critical Control Software") which is fundamental to the business of TimeTrex.
Notwithstanding the terms of this Agreement, neither the Company nor the
Licensed Users may modify any portion of the Critical Control Software. The
violation of this prohibition shall be deemed a material breach of this
Agreement and TimeTrex may immediately terminate this Agreement.

by implication, estoppel, or otherwise.

1.4 Grant to TimeTrex. During any term of this Agreement, Company grants to
TimeTrex a non-transferable, non-exclusive, license to reproduce and display
Company's logos, trademarks, trade names and similar identifying material so

so desire, such as on the TimeTrex website, in press releases and in other
marketing materials.

value-added, excise, customs fees, import duties, stamp duties and any other
similar taxes and duties, including penalties and interest, imposed by any

non-Canadian government entity on the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, excluding taxes based upon TimeTrex's net income.

2.3 Additional Licensed Users Fee. During any Term of this Agreement, Company
shall pay TimeTrex a fee for any subscriptions for Additional Licensed Users as

incurred by TimeTrex associated with reviewing such records.

3.0 Confidentiality

information received by the other party during, or prior to entering into, this
Agreement that a party should know is confidential or proprietary based on the
circumstances surrounding the disclosure, including, without limitation,
non-public technical and business information ("Confidential Information") for
a period of two (2) years after the termination of this Agreement. This section
shall not apply to any publicly available or independently developed information
or the open source version of the TimeTrex software licensed under the TimeTrex
Public License. The receiving party of any Confidential Information of the other
party agrees not to use said Confidential Information for any purpose except as
necessary to fulfill its obligations and exercise its rights under this
Agreement. The receiving party shall protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure
and unauthorized use of the disclosing party's Confidential Information to the
same degree that it takes to protect its own confidential information and in no
event less than reasonable care.

4.0 Infringement and Disclaimer of Warranty
4.1 As Is/Disclaimer of Warranty. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE SOFTWARE AS PROVIDED BY
TIMETREX IS PROVIDED AND LICENSED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. TIMETREX DOES NOT WARRANT OR GUARANTEE THAT THE USE OF THE
SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

4.2 Infringement. During any term of this Agreement, if any portion of the
Software is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to infringe any third
party intellectual property rights and Company incurs a liability or expense
as a result of such holding, then Company's sole remedy shall be, and TimeTrex
will, at its option: (i) obtain the right for Company to continue to use the
Software consistent with this Agreement; (ii) modify the Software so that it
is non-infringing; or (iii) replace the infringing component with a
non-infringing component, or (iv) refund all of Company's money paid in the
then-current calendar quarter under this Agreement and all of Company's rights
and licenses under this Agreement shall automatically terminate.

5.0 Limitation of Liability
5.1 Disclaimer of Consequential Damages. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL TIMETREX BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN ANY WAY
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE OR
DOCUMENTATION INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
WORK STOPPAGE, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, COMPUTER FAILURE OR ANY AND ALL
OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF
AND REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.

5.2 Limitation of All Damages. IN NO EVENT SHALL TIMETREX'S LIABILITY HEREUNDER
FOR CLAIMS IN THE AGGREGATE, EXCEED THE AMOUNT THAT COMPANY PAID TO TIMETREX
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE
ACT OR OMISSION GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY.

5.3 Force Majuere. Except for the payment of fees, neither party shall be in
breach of this Agreement due to failure of performance that arises out of causes
beyond its reasonable control.


6.0 Term and Termination.
The initial term shall commence on the Effective Date of this Agreement and
shall continue for a period of one (1) year unless a different term is
specified by the parties at the time of purchase (the "Subscription Period").
Thereafter, the Agreement shall renew at the then-current License Fees and
Additional Licensed User Fees for successive terms of one (1) year, unless
either party gives written notice to the other of its intention not to renew
at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of a term. Company shall remain
obligated for all fees through the date of termination. Either party may
terminate this Agreement prior to the end of a term if the other party
materially breaches its obligations hereunder and, where such breach is
curable, such breach remains uncured for thirty days following written notice
of the breach. Company's obligation to make a payment of any outstanding,
unpaid fees and to keep Confidential Information confidential and the terms
of Section 1.2 shall survive termination or expiration of this Agreement.


7.0 General
Company agrees and certifies that neither the Software nor any other technical
data received from TimeTrex, nor the direct product thereof, will be exported
outside of Canada or re-exported except as authorized and as permitted
by the laws and regulations of Canada and/or the laws and regulations of the
jurisdiction, (if other than Canada) in which Company rightfully obtained the
Software. Except as expressly provided herein, Company may not assign its
rights or delegate its obligations under this Agreement, without the prior
written consent of TimeTrex. This Agreement will be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the Province of British Columbia and the federal
Canadian laws applicable therein, excluding its conflicts of law provisions,
and Company and TimeTrex agree to submit to the personal and exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts located in the City of Kelowna, British Columbia.
The parties agree the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods will not apply to this Agreement. The failure of
either party to require performance by the other party of any provision hereof
shall not affect the full right to require such performance at any time
thereafter; nor shall the waiver by either party of a breach of any provision
hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself. If any
provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will be
replaced to the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the
meaning of the original provision. This Agreement, and the documents referenced
in this Agreement, constitutes the entire agreement between Company and
TimeTrex relating to its subject matter and all terms herein and supercedes
all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings. This Agreement may
be modified or changed only in writing by authorized representatives of Company
and TimeTrex. Notices hereunder shall be in writing and addressed to Company
at the address provided when purchasing this license, or, in the case of
TimeTrex, when addressed to TimeTrex Software Inc., Attn. Legal Counsel,
Unit 22 - 2475 Dobbin Road. Suite #292 West Kelowna, BC V4T 2E9 Canada.
